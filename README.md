## About

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone enrolled in or interested in the CodingNinjas Java DSA Premium course. The solutions provided here are my personal attempts at solving the problems encountered throughout the course.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

1. **Introduction to Java**: This folder contains solutions to the problems covered in the "Introduction to Java" course.
2. **Data Structures in Java**: This folder houses solutions to the problems related to data structures and algorithms covered in the "Data Structures in Java" course.

## Disclaimer

Please note the following points regarding the usage of this repository:

1. **Solution Updates**: I will be updating this repository as I progress through the course. New solutions will be added, and existing ones may be improved or refined.
2. **Standalone Solutions**: The codes provided here are standalone solutions to the problems. They do not include main methods, data structure initializations, or any other excess code. These solutions are meant to be integrated into your own projects or coding environments.
3. **Running the Code**: The provided solutions may not run by simply copying and pasting the code. You might need to write the main method and other necessary code if you plan to run them in an environment other than Coding Ninjas.

> **Note**: Before jumping onto the solutions, I highly encourage you to try solving the problems yourself first. This will aid in your learning and understanding of the concepts.
